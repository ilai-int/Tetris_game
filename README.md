<h1>Tetris_game</h1>

<b>NOTE: this project has been abandoned!</b>

This was an attmempt to recrate the code from this tutorial: https://javilop.com/gamedev/tetris-tutorial-in-c-platform-independent-focused-in-game-logic-for-beginners/

However, it relies upon several SDL files which have since been deprecated.
In addition, I would rather disown this project, as it is mostly built from pre exsiting code, and thus can't reflect my real capabilities.
